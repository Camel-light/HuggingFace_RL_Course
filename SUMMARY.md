# Summary: Unit 8 Part 1 File Migration

## What Was Done

This PR addresses the issue where `unit8_part1.ipynb` is in the wrong repository.

### Changes Made:

1. **README.md Updated**
   - Changed the Unit 8 Part 1 link from pointing to `Camel-light/Assignments` repository
   - Now correctly points to `Camel-light/HuggingFace_RL_Course` repository
   - The link now matches the pattern used by all other units

2. **Migration Guide Created**
   - `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` provides detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Includes multiple approaches (simple copy, or preserving git history)
   - Covers both adding the file to this repo and removing it from Assignments

3. **Unit 8 README Created**
   - `notebooks/unit8/README.md` explains the current status
   - Provides quick steps for adding the missing file
   - Links to the detailed migration guide

## What You Need to Do

Since the automated system cannot access multiple repositories, you need to manually complete the migration:

### Quick Steps:

1. **Get the file from Assignments repo:**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/Camel-light/Assignments/blob/main/notebooks/unit8/unit8_part1.ipynb
   - Click "Raw" and save the file, or clone the Assignments repo

2. **Add to HuggingFace_RL_Course repo:**
   - Copy the file to the repository root path: `notebooks/unit8/unit8_part1.ipynb`
   - Then commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add notebooks/unit8/unit8_part1.ipynb
   git commit -m "Add unit8_part1.ipynb from Assignments repo"
   git push
   ```

3. **Remove from Assignments repo:**
   - In the Assignments repository, remove the file:
   ```bash
   git rm notebooks/unit8/unit8_part1.ipynb
   git commit -m "Remove unit8_part1.ipynb (moved to HuggingFace_RL_Course)"
   git push
   ```

### For More Details:
See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive instructions and alternative approaches.

## Result

Once you complete the manual steps:
- ✅ Unit 8 Part 1 will be in the correct repository
- ✅ README.md will correctly link to it
- ✅ The file will be removed from the wrong repository
- ✅ The repository structure will be consistent
